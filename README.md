# NN-Visualizer
Neural Network Visualizer for Data and Algorithms Final. NN-Visualizer is an open source Java Neural Network framework.

<h2>Features</h2>

  - Presets to solve common gates (XOR, NOR, AND)
  - Customize Neural Network Structure through GUI
  - Provide manual training data
  - Display an animated graph for MSE over given epochs
  - Customize the learning rate as well as epochs
  - Change activation functions for the hidden layer as well as output layer (Sigmoid and Leaky ReLU)
 
 
 
 <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
 - Multi class classification, implementing SoftMax Activation for the output layer

 - Save and load models from [JSON / YAML file](https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-keras-deep-learning-models/) 
 - Display gradient descent of the model through surface rendering in jFreechart
